Introduction : 

This is a React application that allows users to create and customize cards with various options such as colors, borders, and inner messages.

This README.md file aims to provide an overview of the application's features and functionality.

Upon accessing the application, you will be presented with the main dashboard. From here, you can perform various actions such as creating, editing, and deleting cards, as well as following other users. Let's explore the different features of the application.

Features : 

- A user can see all the cards from all users (or all the public/published cards if you have a way to do this)
- A user can see all the cards they themselves have created
- A user can see all the cards from a user they follow
- A user can design and create a new card
- A user can update (edit) a card they've created
- A user can delete a card they've created
- A user can follow another user
- A user can unfollow another user
- A user can see a list of users they follow

Customizable Options :

When creating a card, you have the following customizable options:

Card Color: Choose a color from a predefined list to set the background color of the card.
Border Style: Select a border style from a predefined list to add visual appeal to your card.
Outer and Inner Messages: The card consists of an outer message and an inner message. The outer message is visible at all times, while the inner message is revealed with a transition when clicked.

Feel free to explore and experiment with these options to create unique and personalized cards!
